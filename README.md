# statistics

This file was created as a resource to streamline Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The purpose of this file is to allow statisticians an easy way to not only analyze data, but to present it to a lower level audience. 

There are several pages to this website. The first being "Projects." You can think of this as a homepage. It serves as a way to store and access projects. 

The next page is "Data," which shows the raw imported data. 

The third page is "Visualization," which allows you to model the data. 

The fourth page is "Modeling," which allows tools for regression modeling and comparison. 

The fifth page is "Hypothesis Testing," which allows testing to be done on the dataset and chosen model. 

The sixth page is "Distributions," which is a tool for probability distribution calculations.

The last page is "Report," which allows for the user to take notes on their data, or create a report, utilizing the plots associated with their EDA.
